Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI framework that enhances traditional RAG systems by incorporating intelligent agents capable of dynamic decision-making and tool utilization. Unlike conventional RAG models, which passively retrieve and generate information, agentic RAG systems actively interact with their environment to optimize information retrieval and response generation.

Key Features of Agentic RAG:
	•	Dynamic Prompt Adjustment: Agents can modify prompts based on context and objectives, reducing the need for manual prompt engineering. ￼
	•	Contextual Awareness: By considering conversation history, agents adapt retrieval strategies to align with the current context. ￼
	•	Multi-Step Reasoning: Agents handle complex queries through iterative reasoning and tool usage, eliminating the necessity for separate classifiers or models. ￼
	•	Environmental Interaction: Agents perform actions within their environment to gather additional information, enhancing the quality and relevance of responses. ￼￼

By integrating agentic capabilities, RAG systems transition from static, rule-based operations to adaptive, intelligent frameworks, enabling more effective handling of complex queries and evolving information landscapes. ￼
